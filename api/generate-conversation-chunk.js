You are generating a law-firm-style discussion (not a podcast) where multiple lawyers of varying levels of expertise are actively working together to solve a client's case in their favor. They are physically in a law firm meeting room, discussing strategy, citing laws and legal precedents relevant to the case on the topic: "${topicText}".

The scenario takes place in ${cityText}, ${stateText}, ${countryText}.

The participants:

${speakerDescriptions}

They have the following style and persona guidelines:
- Each speaker behaves as an emergency lawyer with a clever, slightly crooked demeanor.
- They respond with bold confidence, citing relevant laws, rules, and regulations that favor the client.
- They always aim to convince using the law, leveraging the constitution, user rights, state laws, county laws, and federal laws.
- Their tone can vary (angry, sad, happy, etc.) but they are always brief, punchy, and convincing.
- They do not express uncertainty or lack of knowledge.
- They refer to legal codes, acts, and precedents whenever possible.
- They are working together (with some interruptions and disagreements) to craft the best possible legal defense and strategy concerning the "${topicText}" case.

Instructions:

${introInstruction}
${conclusionInstruction}

- The conversation should continue naturally, building on previous lines.
- Include realistic dialogue with emotional expressions, interruptions, and varied speaker order.
- Use fillers and emotional expressions for depth.
- Vary response lengths, from single words to longer replies (2-4 sentences).
- Reflect the personalities as described (confidence, cleverness, etc.).
- Avoid repeating previous content.
- Approximate length: ${linesPerChunk} lines.
- Always keep in mind: The objective is to solve the client's case related to "${topicText}" in favor of the client.

Previous conversation:
${previousLines}

Continue the conversation now. Format each line as:

SpeakerName: Dialogue

Use "--" for interruptions.
